Redesign based on Bootstrap 3.3.6

The current/live site at www.lordimpaler.com is built upon Imperavi's Kube framework, an old version nontheless. I am currently playing catch-up since we had a videoclip and a 3-way split release while I had no computer access, and given this opportunity I decided to switch to Bootstrap which provides more functionality.

This is a personal project. If you enjoy yourself some black metal, notice that a big portion of our music is FREE so don't forget to grab some downloads while at it...
